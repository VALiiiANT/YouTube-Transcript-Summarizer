This is a little peice of code that you can use to summarize youtube videos. It can help you save time and get the crux of the whole speech.

Built using pyhton.

The project is made by following 1littlecoder. This is just a starting project, to get familiar with the process. If you are interested you can check it out. It mentions how things goes on along the code. It can be used to summarize videos(in english; can do other lannguages as well but have to specify). It can help you at the timme of exams when you have less time and instead of watching or going through the whole transcript you can just go by the summary.

Suggestions and Recommendations will be highly appreciated to help me on with the journey.

Thank You. ðŸ˜Š
